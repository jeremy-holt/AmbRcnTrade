    <h1>Overview of using the system</h1>

    <p>The system follows a sequential process</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The first we know of the goods is when they are inspected. This is done by an Inspector</li>
      <li>When the goods have been approved, the Warehouse Manager will move them into stock. The Warehouse Manager has
        the option to create a new stock entry, or to add it to an existing lot.
        The system automatically generates the stock number and the lot number.</li>
      <li>A lot can be made up of one or many indivudal stock items. The average quality of the stocks (as determined by
        the Inspector) that make up the lot are calculated and are recorded together with the lot.</li>
      <li>Controlling the stocks is done from the Stock Balances page. Here the user can see the stock balance in bags
        and kg. If the weight of the incoming stock was unknown at the time the Warehouse Manager moved the Inspection
        into the stocks, an approximate weight is given of the number of bags x 80 kg </li>
      <li>From the Stock Balances page, the Warehouse Manager will move goods into containers using the Stuffing button.
      </li>
      <li>The Containers page is where new containers are created. Initially the only thing known about the container is
        the Container Number and the Booking number. As more information is known about the container, i.e. the Seal
        Number, the Weighbridge Gross and Nett Weight, the VGM ticket number etc, the user should update the container.
      </li>
      <li>Containers have different statuses, such as Empty, Stuffing Complete, On way to port, Gated, On board the
        vessel etc. It is essential that the status of each container is adjusted to reflect its' physical state, since
        the program uses the container status to provide additional information</li>
      <li>Containers may also be unstuffed on the Containers page</li>
      <li>The Vessels page shows the vessels and their Bills of Lading. From this page the user has access to the Bill
        of Lading page.</li>
      <li>On the Bill of Lading page, the user enters all the relevant information, and also provides the text for the
        body of the B/L. It is from this page that you can add the containers where the container status shows that
        stuffing has been completed.</li>
      <li>The user may automatically print the Packing List, and by using the Upload and Download buttons in the
        toolbar, may upload pdf images of the actual documents - such as draft B/L, Phyto cert etc.</li>
      <li>The Purchase page is where the user records the actual purchases from the suppliers. The procedure is to
        create the Purchase Order, and then allocate goods that are in stock to the Purchase. Stocks can only be added
        from the same supplier that is recorded on the Purchase Order.</li>
      <li>The Payments page is where a record of payments is made to the supplier. The page shows at a glance what has
        been bought from the supplier, and what payments have been made. There is also an option to record payments to a
        third party via the supplier.</li>
      <li>The Address book is where the details of all suppliers, warehouses, consignees etc ar recorded. Each customer
        is allocated a group, such as "Supplier" or "Bill of Lading" for names that will only appear as Shipper,
        Consignee or Notify party. It is important to give each customer their correct group otherwise they will not
        appear in their respective lists.</li>
      <li>If a customer is both a Supplier and a Shipper a seperate Customer should be created for each group.</li>
    </ol>
